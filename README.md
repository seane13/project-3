## Project Overview

The conception of this project was the convergence of modern tech and philanthropy by the minds and hearts of 4 Fintech students. We wanted to build something to help Ukraine in the fight to defend their country and help the victims of the on-going atrocities. As a struggling student, I have neither fiat or crypto currencies to donate to the cause. We then came to realize the need for a donatable option other than currencies. This project's aim is to not only create another channel to raise charitable funds but, to also accept digital art as a donation. The art that is donated will be converted into an NFT and auctioned for ETH. This project is a digital market place which will auction art as well as accept donations in the form of ETH or digital art. All proceeds form this market place will be forwarded directly to approved charities for this cause.

## The DAPP

The Ukraine fund marketplace uses the Ethereum blockchain for this marketplace. The ERC721 smart contracts are written in Solidity and the user's interface will be run through [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). The digital representation of the art will be pinned to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) by [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager)

## How to use

* We used [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to write, compile, and deploy the contracts. 
* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and Rinkeby were used for the test wallet.
* [Rinkeby faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/) offers tokens daily.
* [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) were used for the art
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is used to interact with the contracts
* Languages used include Solidity, Python, and JSON

## Summary

The Ukraine Fund Marketplace is intended as a stepping stone in the evolution of philanthropy and humanity. We are able to extend the arena of resources by using the emerging technolgies of blockchain and smart contracts. The cost efficiencies are also greater for blockchain processed charitables, which means more funds get to those in need compared to traditional methods. Finally, any good faith gesture can become an actionable donation.

If some give a lot and a lot give some, we could all help and receive help when needed. My art is a photograph, maybe yours is a drawing, a coin, or promise to host a displaced family. It is now easier than ever to give, even when you can't afford to give money.
